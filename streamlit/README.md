# Streamlit

The Streamlit app:

- Allows a user to search for different videos in the Snowflake database based on the video's title or description.
- Allows a user to filter videos in the Snowflake database based on video characteristics, like frame size/rate.
- Allows a user to visualize the contrast of the video over time, and identify points in the video where an event that may trigger an epileptic seizure occurs.
